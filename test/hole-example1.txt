Found hole ‘_’ with type: a -> Identity a
    Where: ‘a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
               the type signature for set :: Lens' s a -> a -> s -> s
               at /tmp/flycheck26256YnM/lenses.hs:17:8
    Relevant bindings include
      whole :: s (bound at /tmp/flycheck26256YnM/lenses.hs:18:9)
      x :: a (bound at /tmp/flycheck26256YnM/lenses.hs:18:7)
      l :: Lens' s a (bound at /tmp/flycheck26256YnM/lenses.hs:18:5)
      set :: Lens' s a -> a -> s -> s (bound at /tmp/flycheck26256YnM/lenses.hs:18:1)
      set :: Lens' s a -> a -> s -> s      (bound at /tmp/flycheck26256YnM/lenses.hs:18:1)
    In the expression: _
    In the second argument of ‘($)’, namely ‘_ x’
    In the first argument of ‘l’, namely ‘(const $ _ x)’
